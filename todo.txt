TODOs
- EventStore: event-per file || remove line breaks from user text input || base64 encode JSON

- apply/remove tags from documents
- delete document
- update document description/published date/effective dates

- tag search (including partial text match)
- during document search, as combinations of tags are specified,
    only the remaining intersection of tags is suggested
  e.g. /search/tags?text=asdf&tag=123&tag=456&tag=789 (list of available tags)

as a tag is selected, the id is added to the search so that
1. that tag (and synonyms) are no longer suggested
2. only tags/synonyms associated with documents containing the selected tag are returned

this has the effect of rapidly narrowing the window of available tags instead of making
the user swim through hundreds of useless tags that obviously don't apply and could never
be met as a search condition.

/search/tags?text=search+query&tag=previouslySelectedTagID1&tag=previouslySelectedTagID2

In this search above, "search query" would not return any tag names/synonyms for
previouslySelectedTagID1 and previouslySelectedTagID2. Further, "search query" would attempt
to match names and synonyms for tags for documents that contain by previouslySelectedTagID1
and previouslySelectedTagID2.
