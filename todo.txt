- apply/remove tags from documents
    PUT /documents/:id/tags
    DELETE /documents/:id/tags

    (Multiple tags/documents at a time???)
    apply/remove one or more tags to a single document
      PUT /documents/:id/tags
      DELETE /document/:id/tags/:tags
    apply/remove one tag to one or more documents
      PUT /tags/:id/documents
      DELETE /tags/:id/documents/:documents

As a tag is selected, the id is added to the tag search so that:
1. that tag (and synonyms) are no longer returned in the suggested result set
2. only tags/synonyms associated with documents containing the selected tags are returned

this has the effect of rapidly narrowing the window of available tags instead of making
the user swim through hundreds of useless tags that obviously don't apply and could never
be met as a search condition.

For example:
GET /search/tags?text=search+query&tag=previouslySelectedTagID1&tag=previouslySelectedTagID2

In this search above, "search query" would not return any tag names/synonyms for
previouslySelectedTagID1 and previouslySelectedTagID2. Further, "search query" would only match
names and synonyms for tags for documents that contain by previouslySelectedTagID1 and 2.
